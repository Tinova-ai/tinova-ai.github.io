# Setting Up Nginx with Cloudflare Tunnel for AI API Proxying

In this tutorial, we'll walk through setting up a robust, resource-efficient infrastructure for proxying AI API requests using Nginx and Cloudflare Tunnel. This setup is particularly useful for resource-constrained environments and provides secure, scalable access to AI services.

## Architecture Overview

Our infrastructure consists of:
- **Nginx**: Resource-optimized reverse proxy
- **Cloudflare Tunnel**: Secure tunnel without opening firewall ports  
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated monitoring with GitHub integration
- **Production Server**: Internal server hosting the services

## Why This Architecture?

### Benefits
- **Security**: Outbound-only connections, no inbound firewall rules needed
- **Performance**: Optimized for low-resource environments (1GB RAM)
- **Reliability**: Built-in health monitoring and automated status reporting
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend with additional services

### Use Cases
- AI API proxying and rate limiting
- Secure access to internal services
- Resource-constrained deployments
- Development and staging environments

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- A server with at least 1GB RAM
- Domain access (we use `tinova-ai.cc`)
- Cloudflare account with tunnel capabilities
- Basic Linux administration knowledge

## Step 1: Nginx Configuration

Create an optimized Nginx configuration for resource-constrained environments:

```nginx
# /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
user nginx;
worker_processes 1;  # Single worker for low-resource environments

events {
    worker_connections 512;  # Reduced for memory efficiency
    use epoll;
}

http {
    # Basic settings
    sendfile on;
    tcp_nopush on;
    tcp_nodelay on;
    keepalive_timeout 65;
    types_hash_max_size 2048;
    
    # Compression
    gzip on;
    gzip_comp_level 6;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript;
    
    # Security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    
    # Include site configurations
    include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
}
```

### Reverse Proxy Configuration

```nginx
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf
server {
    listen 3000;
    server_name localhost;
    
    # Health check endpoint
    location /health {
        access_log off;
        return 200 'OK';
        add_header Content-Type text/plain;
    }
    
    # Claude API proxy
    location /claude {
        proxy_pass https://api.anthropic.com;
        proxy_set_header Host api.anthropic.com;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        
        # Buffer settings for efficiency
        proxy_buffering on;
        proxy_buffer_size 4k;
        proxy_buffers 8 4k;
        
        # Timeout settings
        proxy_connect_timeout 30s;
        proxy_send_timeout 30s;
        proxy_read_timeout 30s;
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Cloudflare Tunnel Setup

### Install Cloudflare Tunnel

```bash
# Download and install cloudflared
wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
```

### Authentication and Configuration

```bash
# Login to Cloudflare
cloudflared tunnel login

# Create a new tunnel
cloudflared tunnel create claude-api-tunnel

# Configure DNS routing
cloudflared tunnel route dns claude-api-tunnel claudeapi.tinova-ai.cc
```

### Tunnel Configuration

Create `/etc/cloudflared/config.yml`:

```yaml
tunnel: claude-api-tunnel
credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/[tunnel-id].json

ingress:
  - hostname: claudeapi.tinova-ai.cc
    service: http://localhost:3000
  - service: http_status:404
```

## Step 3: Health Monitoring Setup

Create an automated health monitoring system:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /usr/local/bin/health-monitor.sh

ENDPOINT="https://claudeapi.tinova-ai.cc/health"
LOGFILE="/var/log/claudeapi-status.log"
STATUS_FILE="/var/log/claudeapi-status.md"

# Perform health check
HTTP_CODE=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$ENDPOINT")
RESPONSE_TIME=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{time_total}" "$ENDPOINT")

# Log results
echo "$(date): HTTP $HTTP_CODE, Response time: ${RESPONSE_TIME}s" >> "$LOGFILE"

# Update status file for GitHub integration
if [ "$HTTP_CODE" = "200" ]; then
    STATUS="✅ Healthy"
    COLOR="green"
else
    STATUS="❌ Unhealthy"
    COLOR="red"
fi

cat > "$STATUS_FILE" << EOF
# Service Status Report

**Last Updated:** $(date)

## Services Status

| Service | Status | Response Time | Endpoint |
|---------|---------|---------------|----------|
| Claude API Proxy | $STATUS | ${RESPONSE_TIME}s | $ENDPOINT |

## System Metrics
- **Uptime**: $(uptime)
- **Memory Usage**: $(free -m | awk 'NR==2{printf "%.1f%%", $3*100/$2 }')
- **Disk Usage**: $(df -h / | awk 'NR==2{print $5}')
EOF
```

### Systemd Service Configuration

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/claudeapi-monitor.service
[Unit]
Description=Claude API Health Monitor
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/health-monitor.sh
User=root

# /etc/systemd/system/claudeapi-monitor.timer  
[Unit]
Description=Run Claude API Health Monitor every 5 minutes
Requires=claudeapi-monitor.service

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*:0/5
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

## Step 4: Testing and Validation

### Test Nginx Configuration
```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Test Cloudflare Tunnel
```bash
cloudflared tunnel run claude-api-tunnel
```

### Verify Health Monitoring
```bash
curl -I https://claudeapi.tinova-ai.cc/health
```

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Usage
- Nginx with our configuration uses ~5-15MB RAM
- Much more efficient than Docker-based solutions
- Single worker process optimized for low-resource environments

### Security Features
- Outbound-only connections (no inbound firewall rules)
- Cloudflare's network-level protection
- Proper proxy headers for client identification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**502 Bad Gateway**
- Check if local service on port 3000 is running
- Verify Nginx configuration syntax

**Tunnel Not Connecting**
- Verify credentials file exists
- Check DNS routing configuration
- Review cloudflared logs

**Health Check Failing**
- Ensure /health endpoint is accessible
- Check network connectivity
- Verify SSL certificates

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check nginx status
sudo systemctl status nginx

# View nginx logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

# Check tunnel status
cloudflared tunnel list

# View tunnel logs
sudo journalctl -u cloudflared -f
```

## Conclusion

This setup provides a robust, resource-efficient infrastructure for AI API proxying with:
- Minimal resource usage (suitable for 1GB RAM environments)
- Enterprise-grade security through Cloudflare
- Automated health monitoring and reporting
- Easy scalability for additional services

The combination of Nginx and Cloudflare Tunnel offers an excellent balance of performance, security, and operational simplicity.
